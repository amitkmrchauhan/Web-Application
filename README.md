<h1>Build, Secure and Protect a Web Application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Description:
I developed, secured, and defended a cloud application using Microsoft Azure, implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive data and mitigate cyber threats. Utilizing cryptography, I encrypted data in transit and at rest to ensure its confidentiality and integrity within the application.

To enhance cloud infrastructure security, I employed advanced practices, including access controls, network security groups, and role-based access control (RBAC). Additionally, I deployed a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to shield against common web attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), fortifying the application against exploitation.

With a meticulous security approach, I wrote and published an article on GPS Spoofing, highlighting vulnerabilities in GPS systems and the potential impact of spoofing attacks. Through the integration of security tools and practices, I fortified my cyber blog against emerging threats, solidifying its role as a trusted source of cybersecurity insights.
